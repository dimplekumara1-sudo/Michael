# ðŸšª Logout Functionality - Fixed!

## âœ… What was Fixed

### 1. **Consistent Landing Page Redirect**
- All logout actions now redirect to `/` (landing page)
- Previously some might have redirected to login page

### 2. **Enhanced Navbar Logout**
- Updated `Navbar.tsx` to use async logout
- Added proper error handling
- Ensures redirect even if logout fails

### 3. **New useLogout Hook**
- Created `src/hooks/useLogout.ts`
- Centralized logout logic with automatic redirect
- Clears local storage and session data
- Provides consistent behavior across the app

### 4. **Updated ProtectedRoute**
- Now redirects unauthenticated users to landing page (`/`)
- Previously redirected to login page
- Better user experience

### 5. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Logout works even if Supabase is down
- Clears local data as fallback
- Always redirects to ensure clean UI state

## ðŸ”§ Files Modified

1. `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Updated logout handling
2. `src/hooks/useLogout.ts` - New centralized logout hook
3. `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Updated redirect behavior
4. `src/components/LogoutTest.tsx` - Test component (dev only)

## ðŸŽ¯ How it Works Now

### User Logout Flow:
1. User clicks logout button (in navbar)
2. `useLogout` hook is called
3. Local/session storage is cleared
4. Supabase logout is performed
5. User is redirected to landing page (`/`)
6. UI updates to show logged-out state

### Admin Logout Flow:
- Same as user logout
- Admin is redirected to landing page
- No special admin logout handling needed

### Protected Route Behavior:
- If user tries to access protected route without auth
- Automatically redirected to landing page
- Clean user experience

## ðŸš€ Usage

### In Components:
```tsx
import { useLogout } from '../hooks/useLogout';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const logout = useLogout();
  
  const handleLogout = async () => {
    await logout(); // Automatically redirects to landing page
  };
  
  return (
    <button onClick={handleLogout}>
      Logout
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Testing Logout:
- Add `<LogoutTest />` to any component during development
- Shows current user info and logout button
- Remove before production

## âœ… Verification Steps

1. **Test Admin Logout**:
   - Login as admin@photography.com
   - Click logout from navbar
   - Should redirect to landing page

2. **Test User Logout**:
   - Register/login as regular user
   - Click logout from navbar
   - Should redirect to landing page

3. **Test Protected Routes**:
   - Logout completely
   - Try to access `/admin` or `/dashboard`
   - Should redirect to landing page

4. **Test Mobile Logout**:
   - Use mobile view
   - Open mobile menu
   - Click logout
   - Should redirect to landing page
