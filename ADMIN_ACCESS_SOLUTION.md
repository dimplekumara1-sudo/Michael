2. You'll see the "Admin User Setup" section

### Step 2: Create Admin User

2. Wait for the process to complete
3. Should show "✅ Admin user created successfully!"

### Step 3: Test Login

2. Should automatically login and redirect to admin dashboard
3. Or manually go to `/login` and use:
   - Email: `admin@photography.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

## 🔄 Alternative Method (Manual)

If the automatic method doesn't work:

### Option A: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Authentication > Users
4. Click "Add User"
5. Fill in:
   - Email: `admin@photography.com`

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### After Creating Admin User:

1. **Check Debug Page**:
   - Go to `/debug`
   - Should show:
     - ✅ User exists: Yes
     - ✅ Is Admin: Yes
     - ✅ Email Match: Yes

2. **Test Login**:
   - Go to `/login`
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Should redirect to `/admin`
   - Check browser console for debug logs

3. **Test Admin Dashboard**:
   - Should load without infinite loading
   - Should show admin interface
   - Should display admin user info

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Create Admin User" button fails
**Solution**: Use Manual Method (Option A - Supabase Dashboard)

### Issue: User created but still can't login
**Cause**: Email not confirmed
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users
2. Click on admin@photography.com
3. Check "Email Confirm" checkbox
4. Save changes

### Issue: Login works but redirects to home page
**Cause**: Role not detected as admin
**Solution**: 
1. Check `/debug` page for admin status
2. Look for console logs showing fallback profile creation
3. Verify email exactly matches `admin@photography.com`

### Issue: "Access Denied" on admin page
**Cause**: Profile role not set to admin
**Solution**: The fallback system should handle this automatically

## 🎉 Expected Result

After following these steps:

1. ✅ Admin user exists in Supabase
2. ✅ Can login with admin@photography.com / admin123
3. ✅ Redirects to `/admin` dashboard
4. ✅ Shows admin interface without loading issues
5. ✅ Debug page shows admin status correctly

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Open these URLs to test:
http://localhost:5173/debug    # Create admin user & debug
http://localhost:5173/login    # Test login
http://localhost:5173/admin    # Test admin access
```

## 💡 Why This Happens

The app expects the admin user to exist in Supabase, but since you're setting up a new project, the admin user hasn't been created yet. The debug page now provides an easy way to create this user automatically.

**Most Important**: Start with the debug page (`/debug`) - it has everything you need! 🎯
