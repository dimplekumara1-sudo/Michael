## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### Dashboard Routing
```
✅ User Dashboard Routes:

- /user/dashboard     → UserDashboard

✅ Admin Dashboard Routes:
- /admin              → AdminDashboard
- /admin/dashboard    → AdminDashboard
```

### Enhanced Logout Process
1. **Clear Auth State** - User and profile set to null immediately
2. **Clear Storage** - localStorage and sessionStorage cleared
3. **Supabase Logout** - Proper sign out from Supabase
4. **Redirect Home** - Navigate to landing page
5. **Force Refresh** - Ensures clean state

### Better Authentication Checks
- Added loading states to prevent flicker
- Added proper error handling for unauthenticated users
- Fixed user/profile data display

## 🧪 Testing Your Fixes

### Step 1: Test the Auth Panel
- Look for the **Auth Test Panel** in bottom-left corner
- Shows current authentication status
- Quick access to login/logout/dashboards

### Step 2: Test Admin Flow
1. **Create Admin User**: Go to `/debug` → Click "Create Admin User"
2. **Login**: Use admin@photography.com / admin123
3. **Access Dashboard**: Should redirect to `/admin` automatically
4. **Test Logout**: Click logout → should redirect to homepage

### Step 3: Test User Flow
1. **Register User**: Go to `/register` → Create new account
2. **Login**: Use your user credentials
3. **Access Dashboard**: Go to `/dashboard` or click Dashboard in navbar
4. **Test Logout**: Click logout → should redirect to homepage

### Step 4: Test Dashboard Access
```bash
# Try these URLs after login:
http://localhost:5173/dashboard      # User dashboard
http://localhost:5173/admin          # Admin dashboard (admin only)
http://localhost:5173/debug          # Debug tools
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### ✅ Admin User:
- Login → Redirects to `/admin`
- Navbar shows "Dashboard" → Goes to `/admin`
- Logout → Redirects to `/` (homepage)
- Can access both admin and user dashboards

### ✅ Regular User:
- Login → Redirects to `/dashboard`
- Navbar shows "Dashboard" → Goes to `/dashboard`
- Logout → Redirects to `/` (homepage)
- Cannot access admin dashboard (redirected to homepage)

### ✅ Logged Out User:
- Protected routes redirect to homepage
- Navbar shows Login/Sign Up buttons
- Can access public pages only

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Auth Test Panel (Bottom-Left)
Shows real-time status:
- **Loading**: Authentication check in progress
- **User**: Supabase user object exists
- **Profile**: Profile data loaded
- **Admin**: Admin role detected
- **Email/Role**: Current user details

### Console Logs
Check browser console for detailed logs:
- Login process steps
- Logout process steps
- Profile creation/loading
- Route protection checks

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard shows "Access Denied"
**Cause**: User not authenticated
**Solution**: Login first, then access dashboard

### Issue: Admin dashboard not accessible
**Cause**: User role not admin
**Solution**: 
1. Check `/debug` page for admin status
2. Create admin user if needed
3. Verify login email is `admin@photography.com`

### Issue: Logout doesn't work
**Cause**: Network or auth context issue
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Clear browser cache

### Issue: Infinite loading on dashboard
**Cause**: Authentication state stuck
**Solution**:
1. Check Auth Test Panel status
2. Logout and login again
3. Check `/debug` page for details
